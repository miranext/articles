## Introduction

They say that the Bitcoin bull cycle starts at the beginning of the halving cycle. For those who are not aware, the Bitcoin halving cycle is a four-year cycle that happens every 
time 210,000 blocks are mined. This is around 4yrs. The halving cycle is a mechanism that reduces the block reward by half. With that we can deduce that the selling pressure of
Bitcoin gets reduced by half at least on the miners part. Obviously, mining Bitcoin and selling the rewards are what incentivizes miners to mine Bitcoin and with that they 
would need to regularly sell Bitcoin to fund their mining operations.

## Investing at the Start of the Halving Cycle

So if we wanted to enter the crypto market and we know that the bull cycle starts at the beginning of the halving cycle, then it is prudent to time it as when the new halving 
cycle is above to start. This will then provide us with say a lower risk that we lose part of our invested money. Let's find out what is the actual returns if say we timed 
our investing at the start of the halving cycle and holding Bitcoin up until today.

Below is a table that shows the returns of Bitcoin if we invested at the start of the halving cycle and holding it up until today. The data is from our very own tool
where it can show you the returns if you have invested certain amount given the date when you start investing up until the date of this article.

The table above shows that investing at the start or within the Bitcoin halving cycle provides a very good return up till today. Another giveaway we can see is that
the returns of each halving cycle lowers by 50% every cycle. Would the next halving provide only 20% return up until the next cycle?. Time can only tell but if we wanted 
to start positioning in the crypto market, then it is best to start investing at the start of the halving cycle.
