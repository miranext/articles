# What If You Have Invested with Covered-Call ETF's?
Covered-call ETF's have gained popularity of late as they have given another way to provide an investor regular income in the form of dividend.
This is different from your traditional divident paying ETF's as the income they get is from a a strategy called covered-call. In theory,
they could give additional returns on top of dividends (or provide cashflow in non-dividend paying stocks). Now these returns are obviously does not
come with added risks. Doing a covered call strategy could be beneficial on a fund that mainly holds an index, as that could generate additional returns
on top of the gains of the underlying index. Now the question is, is it really better than just straight up buying the SPY ETF?
