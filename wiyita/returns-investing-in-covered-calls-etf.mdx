## Introduction

Covered-call ETFs have gained popularity of late as they have given another way to provide an investor regular income in the form of dividend.
This is different from your traditional divident paying ETFs as the income they get is from an option strategy called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp" target="_blank">covered-call</a>. In theory,
they could give additional returns on top of dividends (or provide cashflow in non-dividend paying stocks). Now these returns are obviously does not
come with added risks. Doing a covered call strategy could be beneficial on a fund that mainly holds an index, as that could generate additional returns
on top of the gains of the underlying index. Now the question is, is it really better than just straight up buying the SPY ETF?

Below is the table of returns investing in Covered-Cal ETF's. Note that at the moment we don't support showing returns including dividends.
This feature is coming soon and we will be updating this article once we have that. But based on this initial result, we can see that
it is not looking good for these ETFs. Most of them has not beaten the SPY ETF except for JEPQ but do note that JEPQ has only been around for around a year. We can see
clearly that longer term it is really tough to beat straight up SPY ETF investing.
